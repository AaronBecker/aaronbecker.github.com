This week's episode of This American Life tells a very affecting story
about a self-described Apple fan who went to Shenzhen China to see where
so much of our stuff is made. // it's not really about the guy...

Even if China were a democracy, I'm not sure they'd want to do anything
about it. I know essentially nothing about Chinese culture and
attitudes, but I did spend some time there this fall for an academic
conference and had a chance to talk with a lot of students while I was
there. It's hard to get a sense of what people really think through
the language barrier and the cultural barrier, but one thing came
through very clearly and consistently: a fierce pride in the growing
success and power of China. That power and success rest directly China's
industrial might, which in turn rests on mass exploitation of very poor
Chinese people.

So yeah, I feel pretty bad but it's not clear what to do.
