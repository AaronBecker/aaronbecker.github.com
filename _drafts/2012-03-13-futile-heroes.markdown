I've been making my through Iain Banks' Culture series. They are space
operas set in the unrecognizably distant future, where technology is
indistinguishable from magic, and the affairs of the affairs of the
titular civilization, known simply as "the Culture", are dominated by
unimaginably sophisticated artificial intelligences known as Minds.

These are good books, among my favorite in their genre. The prose is
well-crafted, and Banks sketches out a lot of interesting ideas without
getting mired in the details of fictional technology.
