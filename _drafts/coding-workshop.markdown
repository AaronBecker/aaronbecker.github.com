Coding is writing. It's very functional writing, so it's easy to forget
that it's a written art and think of it as distilled digital action.
Indeed, for most people that's probably the right approach to take. It's
impossible to appreciate a novel or an essay without reading it for
yourself, but we all use software that we don't read, and in many cases
can't ever read even if we wanted to.

So yeah, we should treat code more like the written word, and workshop
it and refine it etc
