### [Daydreamer][]
Daydreamer is a chess engine, meaning that it's a
program that knows how to play chess. It uses UCI, a standard text
interface for communication between chess playing programs, that lets
you connect it to many common chess programs so that it can destroy you
in 15 moves or play against other programs. Seriously, it's quite
strong&mdash;it was ranked around #20 in the world by the [Computer Chess
Rating List][ccrl] when it was written, though it's drifted down
somewhat over time. It also plays [Chess960][].

### [Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup][dcss]
Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (aka DCSS, or just Crawl), is a [roguelike][]
game, in the tradition of [Nethack](http://www.nethack.org/) and
[Angband](http://rephial.org/). But way better. It's a huge program
whose roots go back well over a decade and which has involved dozens of
programmers. I started playing the game in the summer of 2011, and since
then I've started to contribute patches to the game and become the
maintainer of the Mac port. I also [play online][cao]&mdash;come say hi if
you see me on [webtiles](http://tiles.crawl.develz.org).

### [Mallard Bane][]
Mallard Bane is a robot that plays the classic Nintendo game [Duck Hunt][].
It doesn't play any dirty tricks like reading out of the game's frame
buffer. It holds an actual Zapper light gun on a pan-tilt head and watches
the tv with a camera. It watches for ducks, and it guns them down. Oh, and it
always shoots the hell out of the dog, as is right and proper. I made Mallard
Bane with my good friends [Kevin Pang](http://twitter.com/kevinpang) and 
[Ian Ferrel](http://twitter.com/ianferrel) as a project for our
robotics class at [Harvey Mudd College](http://www.hmc.edu/).

### [Charm++][charm]
My actual job is working on the Charm++ adaptive runtime system and applications
that use it. Charm lets you write programs that run on clusters of computers,
and it works on some of the biggest supercomputers in the world. It's used every
day for real scientific research, and it accounts for a substantial fraction of
the compute cycles at national supercomputing facilities. I've worked on enough
projects involving Charm that listing them all here would be tedious, and I've
published [a few papers][pubs] on my work as well.
