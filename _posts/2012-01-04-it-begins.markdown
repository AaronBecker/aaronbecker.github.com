Some people have to write. If they stop writing long enough, craziness
starts to seep into their eyes. They will always make time to write, and
if you look at their desks or their websites, you will inevitably find
reams upon reams of material.

I am not one of these people. I tend to write in agonizing fits and
starts, and if I stop writing long enough, I just spend more time
reading or coding or (more likely) browsing the web. Any craziness in my
eyes is well hidden. But writing is good exercise, and in the spirit of
creating things and not just consuming them, I intend to write stuff
regularly and post it here. I can offer no guarantee of a coherent
theme, or even coherent posts. I certainly do not even suggest that I'll
be offering anything edifying or enlightening. But there will be
something. Something I wrote.
