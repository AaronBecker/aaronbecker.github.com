I recently saw this trailer for *Beyond the Black Rainbow* posted on
[The Verge](http://www.theverge.com), and good lord does it look cool.
More specifically, it looks like the director has been mainlining
2001-era Kubrick. Who knows if the movie will be any good or not, but
the visuals, music, and overall aesthetic of the trailer are fantastic.
