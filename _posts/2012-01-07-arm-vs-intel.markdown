It's rare to see an article in a mass-market publication that covers
complex technical issues without facepalm-level errors that ruin the
article for anyone in the field. So, I think it's worth calling out
[this article][] in the Economist on the microprocessor war between
Intel and ARM for telling a complicated technical story in an engaging
way without sacrificing accuracy. The people at the Economist must be
doing something right. Judging from the fact that all the article
subheads are references to Isaac Asimov stories, I imagine that the
thing they're doing right is hiring enthusiastic nerds to cover
technology for them.
