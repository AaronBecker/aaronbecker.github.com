Mark Cunningham recently provided [some advice][] on salary negotiation
that seems generally correct to me. That said, you shouldn't follow it.
Cunningham suggests slowing things down when you get to the stage where
it's time to talk about salary rather than just spitting out a number,
on the theory that you will ask for (and probably get more) if you take
a little time to reflect. Here's how he sees the conversation going:

> "To be honest, I haven't even thought about salary yet. I've been so
> wrapped up in this opportunity and meeting everyone that I haven't had a
> chance to sit down and think about compensation and what I'd be looking
> for. If it's okay with you, I'd like to go home, let it all sink in and
> wake up tomorrow with an idea. Is that okay with you?"

This is all fine, and better than just blurting out a number, but he's
answering the wrong question. Instead of figuring out what number to put
out there, you should be figuring out how to avoid giving them a number
in the first place.

The first person to say a number sets the baseline for negotiation. If
it's you, you're essentially proposing a cap on the compensation you
should be paid. If it's them, they are proposing a floor on your
compensation. You're much better off negotiating upwards.

Of course, companies know this and don't want to give the first number
either. So you need a strategy. Fortunately, Penelope Trunk knows all
about this and has some [great suggestions][] on how to avoid putting a
number out there without feeling like (or acting like) a jerk.

If you're going to put out a number, by all means sleep on it first. But
you'll be better off avoiding it altogether.
