This is my site, False Sharing, where I write about and link to
whatever's on my mind. "[False sharing][]" is a term of art in programming
that refers to data that isn't semantically related but is nevertheless
linked together. It's typically a performance problem caused by cache
behavior, and it can be very difficult to diagnose and fix. I could say
that I named the site False Sharing because the topics on it are only
related by the fact that I'm interested in them, but in fact I just
thought it was a cool name.

This site runs on [Jekyll][], and it's hosted on [Github][] (I love git). I don't really know anything about graphic design or web development, so it's probably riddled with amateur mistakes. In designing the site I leaned heavily on the designs of sites I enjoy, especially [jon.smajda.com](http://jon.smajda.com) and
[marco.org](http://marco.org).
