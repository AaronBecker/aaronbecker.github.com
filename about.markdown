This blog runs on [Jekyll][], and it's hosted on [Github][] (I love git). I don't really know anything about graphic design or web development, so it's probably riddled with amateur mistakes. In designing the site I leaned heavily on the designs of sites I enjoy, especially [jon.smajda.com][] and [marco.org][].
